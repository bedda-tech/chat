/**
 * AI SDK Middleware for logging, monitoring, observability, and caching
 * 
 * NOTE: This file contains middleware implementations that are currently disabled
 * due to type changes in the AI SDK. The functionality is preserved here for
 * future use once the middleware API is stabilized.
 * 
 * To re-enable:
 * 1. Update type imports when AI SDK stabilizes middleware API
 * 2. Import and use with wrapLanguageModel in providers.ts
 * 3. Test with your models
 * 
 * Features included:
 * - Request/response logging with timing
 * - Tool invocation tracking
 * - Performance monitoring
 * - In-memory caching (can be upgraded to Redis)
 * - Cache statistics and management
 */

/**
 * Clear the in-memory cache
 * Useful for testing or when memory needs to be freed
 */
export function clearCache(): void {
  console.log("[AI Cache] Cache clearing not currently active");

/*
 * MIDDLEWARE IMPLEMENTATIONS (Currently Disabled)
 * 
 * The following middleware implementations are preserved for future use:
 * 
 * 1. loggingMiddleware - Logs all AI requests/responses with timing
 * 2. performanceMiddleware - Tracks performance metrics
 * 3. cachingMiddleware - Caches responses to reduce API costs
 * 
 * Example usage (when types are available):
 * 
 * import { wrapLanguageModel } from 'ai';
 * import { loggingMiddleware, cachingMiddleware } from './middleware';
 * 
 * const wrappedModel = wrapLanguageModel({
 *   model: gateway.languageModel('openai/gpt-4'),
 *   middleware: cachingMiddleware,
 * });
 * 
 * See AI SDK documentation for latest middleware API:
 * https://sdk.vercel.ai/docs/ai-sdk-core/middleware
